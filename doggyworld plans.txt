AI
	each AI dog has a dog house and a small area of territory with 2-4 landmarks
		if the AI dog doesn't own those landmarks, they will try to mark them all to claim them
			if all the landmarks in a dog's territory are owned by the player, they stay in their dog house

barking
	player bark is instant, AI bark requires a short build up
	If a player is barked they are forced to flee (either a few tiles away or out of the AI's territory)
	If an AI dog is barked, they hide in their dog house
		after some time, they leave their dog house
			after leaving, the AI dogs are brave for some time and cannot be barked away, but can still bark

winning	
	you've marked all the territories
